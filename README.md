# MLOps Zoomcamp

This is my personal repository for the MLOps Zoomcamp from DataTalksClub. The objective is to learn practical aspects of productionizing ML services â€” from collecting requirements to model deployment and monitoring. 

This repository contains my work through every module as well as my homeworks and my final project.
Feel free to navigate through each module to see my work.
